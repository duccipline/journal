> ##### My desire is to create a place for people who are seeking _serenity_ and trying to escape from the _hustle and bustle_ of city life, so I would look for a location in a quiet street, maybe around the Old Quarter. My café would be decorated _elaborately_ with lights and house plants, creating a calm, homely atmosphere for the customers. Bookshelves filled with books of every kind would run along the walls and in the corners and everyone would be welcome to choose a book from the shelves to enjoy while drinking their coffee. Like many other coffee shops, I would hire students to work as part-time employees at my book café, especially ones who share the same passion for books as I do. They could earn their living in a comfortable and friendly working environment, and I would aim to _nurture_ their love of books, so that their work would become a pleasure.

> ##### Owning my own book café has been my lifelong dream. To read books is to broaden one’s _horizons_, and to drink coffee is to enjoy life. When I reach a certain point in my life where I feel satisfied enough with my career, I will resign and run my small café. I believe that one day I will make my dream come true.
