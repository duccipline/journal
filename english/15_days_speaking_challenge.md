> ##### A couple of months ago, I was assigned to a team at my workplace in order to tackle a big project. As part of the team, I had to cooperate closely with this person. However, we had never really liked each other for several reasons. Firstly, she is much older than I am, so she always thinks she is right and _disregards_ the opinions of others. I would describe her as both _bossy_ and _officious_, although she did not have a more senior position than I did in the company. Secondly, I considered her _irresponsible_ because she did not appear to me to pay serious attention to the project. So, although it was _supposedly_ a group project, I _ended up_ working all _on my own_ as much as possible in order to _see the task through_.  
> ##### As the work was vital for our company, we had to be successful. I therefore had no choice except to _collaborate_ with her in order to finish the job. I would rather have done all the work alone, but if I had refused to work with her as part of the team, then the evaluation of my job performance would have been affected at the end of the year. So, knowing her personality as I did, I _swallowed my pride_ and tried to be patient.  
> ##### Despite our many arguments, we completed the task on time. I learned that sometimes people can work together, even though they don’t _get on with_ each other. It just needs a little bit of time and patience to _work things out_, and each person has to compromise to achieve a common goal.

I was so _into Pikachu’s voice_ that I literally, you know, did research about “How to talk to Pikachu”, then I found Alexa. I’ve heard of Siri, and Cortana, and many other apps that actually allow you to _give orders_ when you are not available to touch your phone or laptop or something like that. But Alexa is different.

Just like Siri, you know, you talk to her, or him to _assign tasks_ that could include basic things like setting alarms or playing music or adding events to your calendar. But the thing is that, with Alexa, you can do things to your _smart household equipment_ even when you are not at home. I mean these pieces of equipment should be connected with Alexa, of course. You can check if your light is still on or not, or set time to start your washing machines or some other cool things. I haven’t actually used it, but I saw my host family in Canada _giving commands_ to Alexa and it was completely incredible. Honestly, it would be super cool if I have one. I can talk to Pikachu in the first place, then, you know, have my own assistant.

> ##### One of the most _prominent historical ﬁgures_ that _strikes_ me was Abraham Lilcon, one of the greatest presidents in American history. I have known about him since I ﬁrst read his stories in the book “Chicken soup for the soul” and I admire his tireless efforts and untiring perserance. Lilcon was born in a poor family and his parents are both illiterate. However, he was really into reading books and he tramped ten miles to borrow books from the library and took them home to read. His life underwent a lot of ups and downs. He failed 11 times in doing his business and politics but he was _strong-willed_ and perseveres to overcome all obstacles and became the American president at the age of 51.
> ##### It was obvious that failure cannot defeat him, and everytime he did not succeed, he _stood up on his own feet_ and _pulled out all the stops_. With his decisiveness and _outstanding intelligence_, when he _took the role_ of a president, he not only retained the independence of the country but he also ended the Civil War, _recovered the national economy_ and _eliminated the slavery_.
> ##### The story of his life has taught me a _profound lesson_ that “As long as I do not give up and persist in pursuing my goals, I will achieve it someday irrespective of any _harsh_ situations”.

> ##### If there is a chance to change something which makes our local area better, I think it's the small library.

> ##### The _standard knowledge_ about _social issues_ of local people is quite low. I will give you a prominent instance about my cousin. She was the same age as me and she just married last week 'cause she had _5 month pregnancy_. But the thing was she didn't know she was pregnant until 2 weeks ago.

> ##### Apparently, she was lack of sexual knowledge and I think that if only my hometown had a library in which there was a wide range of books, she wouldn't have come into troubles. Also with a small library, people at all ages can equip themselves with a reservoir of knowledge about all aspects of life. I'm sure that this change is a significant _turning - point_ in the education of my local area. For example, the literacy rate can be higher, so my province can provide a better well - educated workforce for economy, and unemployment level or other social evils can be mitigated. All in all, the appearance of a library is the key to open a new door for my province.

Fortunately, we were put in by a local person for a night and she found a hotel nearby for us the following morning. Besides people, I found in Sapa many interesting places to play and learn about the _ethnic minorities_ in Vietnam that I just had a chance to see in textbooks and on TV.

The scenery seems to change every few feet. Therefore, many elementary school teachers take their students there to discover the secrets of the Chinese culture and the garden is often rented for filming.

> ##### I always go to the park to let off steam after work because of the stunning natural views there. The garden is breathtaking in every season. When in spring, everything in the garden turns green and the flowers bloom almost at the same time. In summer, the trees are pretty shady so we can watch fish play in the glistening ponds. The trees change colours in autumn and the foliage looks absolutely fascinating. The garden is brilliant even in winter because snow makes it pure and neat.
