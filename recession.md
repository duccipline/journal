# Spiritual Recession

### Wednesday February 17, 2021

* Brief: more than one year ago, perhaps 13 months, there were lots of difficulties apppeared in my life. Instead of facing them bravefully, nakedly, I chose to hide. Remembering about that period, I currently don't understand why that man managed to do so.
* Right now writing these lines, I can even hear a voice, the British one, not in my mind but in my room. That's my voice with (I trully believe) a British accent.
* Talked to my friends, one of them has made a statement: he trully understands what I've lost, he claims that if he had been me, he would have been in crisis state also.
    * He told me that I'd lost my future, what future?
    * An expectation in future
    * It seems legit to me: there were many things, good things I've planned to do but have never had enough resources, powers to do (at least, that's my illusion strongly supported by unconfidence, uncertainty, fk doubt).
* For one year of hiding, refusing the responsibilites to solve my-life-problems, thing getting worse. 
* It's the second best time to make a change, I don't know, I must change.
* CHANGE or keeping being trapped, dangerously morose, and being losing more CHANCEs in life.

* I just want to write a line for you:
    * Believe in your goals, believe in your plans, and do your best for them.
