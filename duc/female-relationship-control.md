* Positions herself as the most valuable party (relationship prize)
* Sets a frame where the man’s job is to cater to her needs ("provider frame")
Assesses the man’s value and worthiness based on how well he provides for her (judge frames)

Women &rarr; subconsciously  
Men &rarr; don't even realizing  

# How Women Domesticate Men  

* Women usually take charge and subjugate &rarr; take control of the _frame of reference_ (what good, wrong, proper, improper, what are standards)  
* Men hardly challenge her frame

She uses the following compliance tools:  

* Drama & nagging (set the priorities of what’s important)
* Blaming & criticism (browbeats him on the defensive)
* Shaming (the compliance superpower)

with these tools &rarr; becomes the relationship leader &rarr; Task him (so he can provide for her and make her happy)  

## 1. Drama & Nagging

### 1.1 Nagging

* Nagging is a **long term**, semi-permanent behavioral changing tool.  
    * Conditioning of reward/punishments (_behaviorism_)
    * &rarr; do what I like, and you make me happy
    * &rarr; don’t do what I like, and you fall from my grace and get my nagging wrath (negative reinforcement)

> Nagging is the human equivalent of shock grids to the rat.  

### 1.2 Drama

* Drama is **concentrated**, **focused** laser beam compliance tool  
* Nagging &rarr; what's _important_, drama &rarr; what's _urgent_
    * Nagging: "you’re not OK"
    * Drama: "what you are doing _right_ now is not OK, move your ass now to change it"

> Her: (emotional, yelling, shoving him) Hooooneey, go, do something (points towards where he needs to go)! Harry! Hurry!  
> Him: (gets up and takes action)  
> Her: (keeps the pressure high with high emotions and directs his behavior)  

* The secret of drama is **emotions**
    * Women put a lot of emotions and passion into drama &rarr; deliver it with a self-righteous attitude "I'm right"
* Men do not engage in drama + not used to that _over-emotional_ (and _aggressive_) type of communication
    * Fail to see it for what it is: a compliance tool

&rarr; Most men take ownership of her drama and make it their _top_ priority to fix it

### 1.3 Nagging & Drama = Judge Power Tools

* Both nagging and drama are punishment and compliance tools of the _judge power position_
* They both say "you are not doing your job", "you are not being good enough" &rarr; She (unconsciously) uses them to mold him to her liking

## 2. Blaming & Criticism

* Blaming & Criticism: verbal aggression tools &rarr; push men on defensive
* What he communicates when he defends:
    1. Admits guilt
    2. Confirm she's in charge
    3. Confirm he must serve her and make her happy

Most men, _dumbfounded_ by her attacks/emotional outbursts &rarr; react:

1. Get defensive (bad)
2. Make excuses (terrible)
3. Try to fix the issue (bad: it doesn’t address the real issue, which is the aggressive delivery)
4. Fight her (soso, it looks over-reactive and doesn’t work when he’s wrong)
5. Ask her to calm down (bad)
6. Tries to understand the real issue (works on some instances, but doesn’t address the blaming issue)

* Trying to **understand** and to **uncover** the real issue behind the complaint goes to the **root** of the problem.  
* Relationship researcher [Gottman](http://thepowermoves.com/the-seven-principles-for-making-marriage-work-summary) calls "looking beyond the complaint"
* But that's _exactly_ the major flaw of this solution

The real issue indeed here is: she is using verbal abuse and verbally coercive tactics to make him fall in line.  
And that’s what a man should address first: the _way_ she approaches the issue -and only after he can deal with the issue.

> (Enters back home with two heavy bags of groceries, places them on the kitchen table)  
> Him: here is the shopping, help me store it  
> (She starts going through the bags)  
> Her: OMG where is the cheese! Didn’t I tell you this morning to get the cheese? I can’t believe you forgot it, it was such a simple task! How am I going to prepare pasta now without the cheese! You always do this!  

* He indeed made a mistake &rarr; often end up on the defensive there  
* But the problem of defending is that he **does not** address the real issue, which is **not the small mishap**, but her aggressive tone.
* Even more importantly, it **confirms her frame of power**: that he must serve her and execute her tasks (and do so properly).
* Cherry on the pie, that’s a nasty and aggressive way of communicating and it does nothing good to the relationship.

### How to Deal with Blaming

Here is how you handle blaming instead:

> Her: OMG where is the cheese!  
> Didn’t I tell you this morning to get the cheese? I can’t believe you forgot it, it was such a simple task! How am I going to prepare pasta now without the cheese! You always do this!  
> (pause a few seconds, look at her)  
> You: I am not comfortable with your tone  

You don’t address the perfunctory cheese issue but, calm and collected, you go to the crux of the matter.  

> Her: What do you mean my tone, what are you talking about, you didn’t buy the cheese!  
> You: That is the case indeed. I forgot the cheese. But how does that give you the right to raise your voice and verbally assault me  

By admitting that you did indeed made a mistake you protect yourself from further attacks.  
And by making your criticism more specific -and more emotionally charged- you are now playing the same game and backing her against the corner.  

> Her: Assaulting you? I’m not assaulting you! I’m just saying you forgot the cheese, how can I cook pasta now  
> You: You are yelling at me with an aggressive facial expression for what’s a very, very minor issue. That’s verbal abuse in my book  

As soon as you get her to admit that she overreacted and/or that aggression is not the way to deal with issues, you want to say something like this:  

> You: Look, I did forget the cheese, my bad.  
> But to me it’s more important how we deal with issues. Because cheeses come and go, but how we deal with each other stays.  
> And blaming, yelling, finger pointing and any other nasty way of communicating are not what I consider good and healthy relationships.  
> And I want to have a healthy and respectful relationship with you because that’s how I treat you and I expect the same back.  
> (pause)  
> Do I make myself clear?  

With that, you addressed the **power dynamics**: you are _not_ a punching bag for her anger.

Now you can move to the **root causes** of this particular issue.

* To get to the root causes of a situation like this &rarr; think about your priorities.  
* And if you realize that you don’t care about cheese and you don’t want to spend your life shopping for cheese, then assign the task of what it’s important to her back to her.  
* Tell her candidly that since you don’t care about cheese, you will probably forget again in the future. And you will not take any responsibility for stocking up cheese ever again.  
* From then on, what she cares about is what she takes responsibility for.  

## 3. Shaming

* Shame is the superpower of the _judge role_
* Shame is a tool of psychological **aggression** and **compliance**.
    * Shame leverages our need to be worthy of love and basic respect
    * Shame punishes us with scorn, isolation, by stocking feelings of unworhiness
* When women use shame in a relationship &rarr; they attack something that every man feels deeply inside: _what it (supposedly) means to be a man_.
    * Some of the most powerful attacks on manhood are:
    * Unsuccessful
    * Weak
    * Impotent
    * "Pussy"

> Her: (shaking her head in judgmental attitude) Oh, Jesus Christ, David! Is she one of yours?  
> Him: It was Berlin  
> Her: (Sarcastic) Oooooh great. Oh that’s great (…) A power differential equals coercion. You’re so weak!  

* The power of shame is compounded when, as it’s often the case, the whole society stands behind the accusation -ie.: the whole society takes the judge position against him-.
* This is the case for weakness for example, as a man is not supposed to be weak. But it’s also the case of providing for the family, or protecting women.
* Men internalize those values and beliefs, which allow women to push his manhood thumbscrews without even having to be too direct.

In relationships women can leverage shame to cage men into **provider roles**, potentially sabotaging his own goals and dream.

> Her: And he said, I’m not gonna look for a job, I’m going into the restaurant business (…) I looked at him and I said “you get your butt back to that job, and you pay the mortgage”  

In some cases, it might be argued that it’s fair to shame some men: for example if children who need to be fed are involved. And some men might even deserve some shaming.  
In that case, fair game.  
&nbsp;  

However, women will often take an attitude that enlarges the scope of “what it means to be a man” to fit what they want and need.  
So shaming becomes:  

> Her: I’m unhappy. Make me happy (or you’re not a real man)  
> You: OK, let me try some monkey dancing  
>   
> Her: Protect me and make me feel safe. Buy a house in the good part of town (or you’re not a real man)  
> You: OK, working hard on that promotion…  
>   
> Her: Make me come (or you’re not a real man)  
> You: OK, lemme learn how to last longer and how to give head so I can make you happier…  

Notice that none of the above are wrong _per se_.  
But they _do_ are unhealthy and manipulative when they are not part of a balanced relationship of give and take.  

[Tom Bylieu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Sf3vMMErwg)  
> Tom: I want to walk away from all this work I hate, it’s destroying me
> Wife: I bet on you (= I bet on you to provide for me, don’t disappoint me!)
> Tom: She bet on my relentlessness, so I had to find a way (to make money and make her wealthy)

I’d like to stress again that Tom is an amazing fella, and there is nothing inherently wrong with being a provider.  
Being a high-quality provider in a healthy relationship does more good to society than being a player.  
BUT there is a big difference between a high-quality provider, leader of the relationship and overall high-quality man, and a clueless guy who is being played and provides as the submissive party of the relationship.  

### How to Deal with Shaming

If women want to control men they should indeed use shame and enlarge the scope of “what it means to be a real man” and “what it means doing a good job as a male figure”.  
And what if men want to be free and throw off the yoke?

Then you can completely discard the whole notion of “being a real man”. Fuck being a real man, why should you let anyone dictate what _you_ should be and do? Be whatever you wanna be instead.  
OR, men can come up with _their own_ personal definition of what it means to be a man and only obey to their own standards.  

## 4. Tasking

### How to Deal with Tasking

* Think about what you can and cannot do
    * You’re not a boy anymore, and you should not aim to be one.
    * If you want a relationship, then you do need to change some of your habits, commit to something and compromise on something else.
    * But that doesn’t mean you should do all she wants you to do.
    * Think of what you can and cannot do, and make it clear. Communicate it well and assertively enforce your boundaries. Drama, nagging and tasking will drop to (near) zero.
* Return to sender all her tasks
    * As we have seen for blaming, we now come full circle: all the tasks that are dear to her, but not to you, are her tasks.

> You: Wait a second. Do I want cheese on the pasta, or do you want cheese pasta? Because as far as I know, you want cheese on the pasta.
> You: So why are you asking me to take care of it?

Basically it’s this: do what you agreed on and _task her to do her own tasks_. Then enforce those boundaries when she tries to unload her stuff on you.  

## Tasking + Drama + Shaming = He's Owned

When a man resists or is slow in taking action, a woman can combine all the tools at once:  

1. Drama, to make action seem more urgent and important  
2. Shame, in the sense of “do something (or you’re not a real man)”  
3. Tasking: go do it for f\*ck sake!  

## Why do Women Work to Control Men?

Why do women work so hard to control men and take the reins of the relationship?  

We can speculate -remember: parts of evolutionary psychology is speculative- that women who were able to better control men’s resources and investment have been more successful over evolutionary time, had more children who survived and thrived, and spread their “controlling genes” far and wide.  
And that’s why women’s techniques of compliance and control are today the norm, rather than the exception.  

A domesticated man makes for better-fed children, and for an easier life.  
In the end, a woman’s work on a man is an act of domestication. He goes from free-grazing wild beast to cart-pulling ox.
